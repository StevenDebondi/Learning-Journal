Joomla was very confusing to me after learning about WordPress for the last week or two, I still didn't really get a good grasp on the CMS itself and am still confused on a lot of issues and how to change many parts of the site, this could be template related as it seemed like it had next to no customization, and things I tried to insert did not fit well, or just related to the CMS.
