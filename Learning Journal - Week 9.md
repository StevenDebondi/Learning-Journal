**Week 9**
=====


**Learning Activities**
====================
LinkedIn learning course for Sass

Weekly Panopto content

My learning theory this week is to watch the videos without any other distractions, turning off my other monitors not being used for watching and taking notes and focusing on the content with 100% of my attention.

The test is to try recall information, or see how much better my notes are than compared to previous learning where my attention was split.

**Resources/Links**
================
https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sass-essential-training/
Watched about 30 minutes of the above before realizing there was a newer version as linked below

**Estimated Hours**
================
4 hours

**Content Insights**
================
Sass (SCSS) helps with DRY (don't repeat yourself), much more convinient to change variables such as colour, variations of said colours, sizes of containers. Makes the dev job a lot easier, adds functions, true variables and mixins(Mixins allow you to make a group of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout the entire site). Sass also allows you to nest rules within each other, rather than seperately like CSS (header, header nav and header a all in one area rather than seperated).
Task runners automate regular tasks to simplify and automate your dev workflow.


**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**
=======================================
For employability and career possiblities, It is a very important part of a modern Frontend Web Dev's skillset, making your job easier and less maintenance to do later on, much easier to change variables and slight changes to colours, etc.
Task runners allow you to work on your Sass while they automatically update or convert the files to the needed format.

Results of the theory / experiment for the week seemed to help me understand the content better and take better notes. However, it also may have helped that I had previous knowledge of CSS and this could have impacted the results.
